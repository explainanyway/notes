        <h1>Introduction to Equation</h1>

        <h2>Variable</h2>

        <p>Below is an example of simple mathematical equations.</p>
    
        <p>\[ x = 2 + 3 \]</p>

        <p>On the right hand side of equal sign, are some numbers and operations; on the left side is a variable, an unknown number \( x \).</p>

        <p>We find \( x \) by doing the operations on the right and get \(x = 5\).</p>

        <h2>Order of Operation</h2>

        <p>Operations have order, multiplication and division have higher order than addition or subtraction. So below, we do the multiplication and division first, then the subtraction.</p>
        <p>
            \[ \begin{align*}
                x &= 3 \cdot 2 - \cfrac{4}{2} \\
                &= 6 - 2 \\
                &= 4
            \end{align*} \]
        </p>

        <h2>Term and Factor</h2>

        <p>The order of operations is actually related to the structure of equation. The side of a simple equation actually  are terms or addition/subtraction of terms. And the terms, in turns, consists of just a number or multiplication/addition of numbers. In the following, the right hand sides consists of three terms, each consist of three, four and one number(s).</p>

        <p>\[ x = \cfrac{3 \cdot 4}{2} - \cfrac{6 \cdot 12}{9 \cdot 2} + 2 \]</p>

        <p>Above the multiplications and divisions act on the numbers. But the subtraction and addition act on the whole terms on its left and right, not on just individual numbers</p>

        <h2>Operation Inside Terms</h2>

        <p>We can simplify the terms in previous equation. In the first one we can do multiplication first and then division, but the order of operation inside a term actually doesn't matter. We can also divide \(4\) by \(2\) first and then multiply the result to 3.</p>

        <p>
            \[ \begin{align*}
                x &= \cfrac{3 \cdot 4}{2} - \cfrac{6 \cdot 12}{9 \cdot 2} + 2 \\
                &= 3 \cdot 2 - \cfrac{6 \cdot 12}{9 \cdot 2} + 2 \\
                &= 6 - \cfrac{6 \cdot 12}{9 \cdot 2} + 2
            \end{align*} \]
        </p>

        <p>For the second term, the normal way is to multiply the numbers above, and those below the division, and then divide the results above from the result below. But we can actually choose any two numbers to operate as long as we mind the position of the numbers, above or below.</p>

        <p>
            \[ \begin{align*}
                x &= 6 - \cfrac{6 \cdot 12}{9 \cdot 2} + 2\\
                &= 6 - \cfrac{3 \cdot 12}{9} + 2 \\
            \end{align*} \]
        </p>

        <p>To divide \(6\) above by \(2\) below, we can also see division as fraction. So, seeing \(12\) and \(9\) in the terms as one, we can simplify it by dividing both by \(3\).</p>

        <p>
            \[ \begin{align*}
                x &= 6 - \cfrac{3 \cdot 12}{9} + 2 \\
                &= 6 - \cfrac{3 \cdot 4}{3} + 2
            \end{align*} \]
        </p>

        <p>We can then cancel the \(3\)'s to get the second term on its simplest form.</p>
        
        <p>
            \[ \begin{align*}
                x &= 6 - \cfrac{3 \cdot 4}{3} + 2 \\
                &= 6 - 4 + 2
            \end{align*} \]
        </p>

        <h2>Operation On Terms</h2>

        <p>Now, let's solve the equation above. Yes, we can proceed from left to right. But we can actually choose any number to operate first. Let's choose 6 and 2 to do the addition, and then subtract 4 from the result.</p>

        <p>
            \[ \begin{align*}
                x &= 6 - 4 + 2 \\
                &= 8 - 4 \\
                &= 4
            \end{align*} \]
        </p>

        <p>As alternative, we can also operate on \(4\) and \(2\) first. But notice that \(4\) subtracts, hence we must consider it together with the minus sign in front of it as negative number \(-4\) and the result is \(-4 + 2 = -2\). And since it is negative, we then stubtract 6 with 2.</p>

        <p>
            \[ \begin{align*}
                x &= 6 - 4 + 2 \\
                &= 6 - 2 \\
                &= 4
            \end{align*} \]
        </p>
